Foreword
---

CPCEC is an emulator of the family of home microcomputers Amstrad CPC
(models 464, 664 and 6128) whose goal is to be loyal to the original
hardware and efficient in standard modern systems. Thus it brings a
faithful emulation of the Z80 microprocessor and it replicates the
behavior of the CRTC 6845 and Gate Array video chips, the PSG AY-3-8912
sound chip, the remaining circuits found in the original hardware, and
the tape deck and floppy disc drive that made possible loading and
running software.

The source code of CPCEC and its binaries follow the GNU General Public
License v3, described in the file GPL.TXT within the package.

Requirements and setup
---

CPCEC requires a Microsoft Windows 2000 operating system or later. The
minimal hardware requirements are those fitting the operating system,
and it's advised that the main microprocessor runs at 400 MHz at least.
Screen resolution in pixels must be 800x600 at least. A sound card is
optional. Using a joystick is optional, too.

The emulator spans several files: the runnable binary proper CPCEC.EXE
and the firmware files CPC464.ROM, CPC664.ROM, CPC6128.ROM and
CPCADOS.ROM. All these files must be copied in a single directory,
ideally created to host the emulator.

The binary can be compiled from the source files by following the
instructions stated inside them. GCC 4.9.2 and TCC 0.9.27 work
correctly; GCC 4.7.1 makes severe mistakes in compilation and generates
invalid binaries.

Configuration and files
---

The behavior of CPCEC can be configured by specifying optional
parameters in the command line. It's convenient to keep the user's
preferred parameters by creating a link or shortcut to the emulator
in the system menu and including said parameters within the link.
Options can be abridged in Unix style: for example '-C -d -J' becomes
'-CdJ'. In case of doubt, the parameter '-h' shows a short help
explaining the available options.

	* -C : emulate a green screen instead of (by default) full
	colour;
	* -c0 : set the scanline type to medium;
	* -c1 : set the scanline type to normal (by default);
	* -c2 : set the scanline type to simple interlace;
	* -c3 : set the scanline type to double interlace;
	* -d : start the emulation with the debugger on (by default
	off);
	* -g0 : emulate the CRTC type 0 (by default);
	* -g1, -g2, -g3, -g4 : ditto for the other four types of CRTC;
	* -h : short help;
	* -j : enable emulation of joystick on keyboard (cursors and
	keys Z, X and C);
	* -J : disable the usage of a joystick plugged to the system;
	* -K : emulate 64k RAM only instead of (by default) 128k;
	* -m0 : start emulation with the model CPC464;
	* -m1 : start emulation with the model CPC664;
	* -m2 : start emulation with the model CPC6128, by default;
	* -O : hide onscreen indicators (by default shown);
	* -R : disable real time emulation (by default enabled);
	* -S : disable sound (by default enabled if there's a sound
	card);
	* -X : disable emulation of disc drives (by default enabled);
	* -Y : disable tape analysis (by default enabled; see below);
	* -Z : disable tape acceleration (by default enabled).

It's also possible to add file names to the command line: the emulator
will try opening and running the specified files. Thanks to it CPCEC can
be linked to the file extensions CDT, CSW, DSK and SNA to automatically
load said files.

The file types supported by the emulator are divided in three types:

	* WAV, CSW and CDT: tape files, or more properly digital dumps
	of the contents of a magnetic tape used to store and distribute
	data and software.
	* DSK: disc files, virtual translations of the structure and
	contents of a magnetic floppy disc able to contain data and
	software.
	* SNA: "snapshots", integral copies of the state of an emulated
	system that make possible resuming in a later time said state of
	emulation.

Tape playback relies on two methods (enabled by default) to improve the
user experience by shortening a procedure that was originally very slow:
a typical programme on tape took five minutes to load. The first method
(tape acceleration) simply detects whether there's a tape in and the
cassette motor is active: in that case the emulator starts running at
its maximum possible speed. The second method (tape analysis) examines
the current state of the Z80 and detects whether it's trying to read the
tape in a known way: in that case it modifies its state to instantly
generate the playback results instead of waiting for the tape to raise
the next signal.

Automatic loading of disc files tries detecting on its own the required
booting method. Because some discs had more than one possible booting
point and the emulator is in risk of choosing an unwanted one, the user
can choose it on his own by typing the command RUN"FILENAME (where
FILENAME is the booting file, that is often specified in the software
instructions, or be simply DISC or DISK) in the emulated system and
pressing RETURN. In case of doubt, the command CAT shows the list of
files stored inside the disc.

Function keys
---

Once it's running, CPCEC shows the screen of the emulated system and
obeys the user's commands, that besides those belonging to said system
(control and alphanumeric keypresses, motions of the joystick, either
real or emulated through the keyboard) include a series of special
function keys. In case of doubt, key F1 shows a short index of these
function keys.

	* F1: short help;
	* F1+Control: emulator authorship;
	* F2: record the emulation's current state into a snapshot;
	* F2+Control: record again the last selected snapshot;
	* F3: load and run a tape file, disc file or snapshot;
	* F3+Control: load again the last selected snapshot;
	* F4: enable (or disable) sound emulation;
	* F4+Control: enable (or disable) the keyboard-emulated
	joystick;
	* F5: choose the emulated CPC firmware model;
	* F5+Control: reset the emulation;
	* F6: enable (or disable) realtime emulation;
	* F6+Control: raise the speed of the emulated Z80 from 4 MHz to
	8, 12 and 16 MHz;
	* F6+Control+Shift: lower its speed to 12, 8 and 4 MHz;
	* F7: insert a disc file into the virtual disc drive A;
	* F7+Shift: insert a disc file into the virtual disc drive B;
	* F7+Control: remove the disc from the virtual disc drive A;
	* F7+Control+Shift: remove the disc from the virtual disc drive
	B;
	* F8: insert a tape file in the virtual tape deck;
	* F8+Shift: start recording a new tape file;
	* F8+Control: remove the tape from the virtual tape deck;
	* F9: enable the debugger (see below);
	* F9+Shift: show (or hide) the onscreen indicators;
	* F9+Control: enable (or disable) tape acceleration;
	* F9+Control+Shift: enable (or disable) tape analysis;
	* F11: toggle the colour mode between green and three levels of
	colour of increasing brightness;
	* F11+Shift: ditto in reverse, moving through decreasing
	brightness colour levels;
	* F11+Control: change the type of scanlines, from medium to
	double interlace;
	* F11+Control+Shift: ditto in reverse, from double interlace to
	medium;
	* F12: record the content of the screen into a BMP file;
	* F12+Control: start recording (or stop) the sound into a WAV
	file;
	* F12+Control+Shift: start recording (or stop) the sound into a
	YM file;
	* Pause: stop (or resume) emulation;
	* Alt+Return: maximize (or restore) the window.

Files BMP and WAV are the namesake standard files of image and sound. YM
files are dumps of the sound chip states, that because of their usage in
other platforms besides the Amstrad CPC (Spectrum 128, MSX, Atari ST...)
can be emulated and played back independently in third party programmes
such as STSOUND and AY-EMUL. Notice that the scanline mode (option that
simulates several types of screen) mirrors itself on the recordings as
well as on the screen, and that each mode has a different impact on the
programme performance: the normal mode consumes the most processing
power, and the double interlace, the least.

The onscreen indicators show the state of the disc drives (track number,
busy or idle), the tape deck (busy or idle) and the joystick.

The following keys adjust the frameskip: the higher this parameter, the
lower the required processing power, but also the lower the visual
smoothness. Ideally it should keep its value to 0 unless 1.- the system
lacks enough processing power, or 2.- the user needs to speed the
emulation up for a while.

	* Num.+ : increases the value of frameskip, up to 50;
	* Num.- : decreases the value of frameskip, down to 0;
	* Num.* : sets the value of frameskip to the maximum, 50;
	* Num./ : sets the value of frameskip to the minimum, 0.

CPCEC supports drag-and-drop. Dropped files will be automatically loaded
(as F3 does) unless the Shift key is down; in this case they will be
inserted as F7 and F8 do.

Debugger
---

The debugger is used to stop the emulation and examine its internal
state. It's based on a command line interface that shows the current
technical state of the system (values of the Z80 registers and of the
Gate Array, CRTC and PSG devices) and waits for the user to type a
command. In case of doubt 'h' shows a short command help.

	* the empty string (press RETURN without writing anything) runs
	the current instruction and goes to the next one. In a typical
	debugger this operation is called "step into".
	* 'af VALUE' assigns the numeric value VALUE to the Z80 register
	AF. 'bc VALUE', 'de VALUE', 'hl VALUE', 'ir VALUE', 'ix VALUE',
	'iy VALUE', 'sp VALUE' do the same with the Z80 registers BC,
	DE, HL, IR, IX, IY and SP.
	* 'j VALUE' (jump) sets the value of the Z80 PC register: it's
	equivalent to the Z80 "jumping" to the address VALUE.
	* 'd VALUE' (disassembly) shows a partial disassembly of the
	memory located in the address specified by VALUE. If only 'd' is
	written the new disassembly continues where the previous one
	ended.
	* 'm VALUE' (memory) shows a partial hexadecimal dump of the
	memory located in the address specified by VALUE. If only 'm' is
	written the new dump continues where the previous one ended.
	* 'p VALUE VALUE1 VALUE2 ...' (poke) writes the values VALUE1,
	VALUE2, etc. on the consecutive memory addresses beginning from
	VALUE.
	* 'r VALUE' (run to) disables the debugger and resumes the
	emulation until the emulated Z80 must run the instruction
	located in the address specified by VALUE. In that case the
	emulation will stop and the debugger will automatically enable
	itself. If only 'r' (step over) is written the interruption will
	happen on the instruction after the current one; notice that
	this isn't equivalent to running just the current instruction if
	this one performs a jump, because the instruction that runs
	after the next one is no longer the one after it but the one in
	the address specified by the jump.
	* 's VALUE VALUE1 VALUE2 ...' (search) looks for the string of
	values VALUE1, VALUE2, etc. in the memory addresses beginning
	from VALUE. It lists the addresses containing said string; if
	they're too many, it will show '...' and stop.
	* 'h' (help) shows a short help.
	* 'q' (quit) stops the debugger and resumes the emulation.

Usage of upper and lower case is unimportant; the debugger isn't case
sensitive. The values shown on screen and the command parameters use
hexadecimal notation: for example, to write into the memory address
32768 (and following) the values 83, 79 and 83 you must write 'p 8000 53
4F 53' where 32768 = $8000, 83 = $53 and 79 = $4F. Finally, it's
perfectly feasible to feed series of commands written in advance in a
script by redirecting the standard input, i.e. "cpcec -d snapshot.sna
< script.txt".

ZXSEC
---

ZXSEC is an emulator of the Sinclair Spectrum family (48k, 128k,
+2/Plus2 and +3/Plus3) based on the components it shared with the
Amstrad CPC family: the Z80 microprocessor, the PSG AY-3-8192 sound
chip, the tape system and the NEC765 disc drive controller.

It spans the files ZXSEC.EXE, SPECTRUM.ROM, SPEC128K.ROM, SPEC-P-2.ROM
and SPEC-P-3.ROM, and otherwise runs the same as CPCEC, with several
exceptions:

	* option -mX chooses one out of four possible models: -m0
	(48k), -m1 (128k), -m2 (+2) or -m3 (+3).
	* option -K disables the PSG AY-3-8912 sound chip (enabled by
	default) if the chosen model is Spectrum 48k;
	* option -X disables the disc drives if the chosen model is
	Spectrum +3, that thus becomes a +2A instead;
	* Control+Shift+F8 starts (or stops) the cassette motor, because
	the CPC hardware includes a built-in tape control, while the
	Spectrum hardware lacks it.
	* joystick options apply to the Kempson interface by default;
	the menu allows choosing the type of joystick.

Emulation is less precise than CPCEC's. Several special effects based on
timing work correctly (border raster effects in "Starion" and "Vectron"
for 48k, attribute raster effects in "Amaurote" and "Zub" for 128k) but
the emulation of the Issue 2 ULA (the option -I) is extremely basic, and
contended memory emulation is limited.

Acknowledgements

This emulator owes its existence to a series of people and societies
that are listed as follows:

	* The firmware files included in the package are Amstrad's
	properties, who allows the emulation of their old computer
	systems and supports the distribution of their firmwares as long
	as their authorship and contents are respected, and whom I
	wholeheartedly thank the creation of those magnificent computers
	and the good will towards their emulation.
	* This emulator was my final project for the Computer
	Engineering postdegree at the Distance-Learning National
	University (Universidad Nacional de Enseñanza a Distancia,
	UNED), a project directed by professor José Manuel Díaz Martínez
	and finally awarded a 100% and the right to a honorable mention.
	* The documentation about the system comes from cpcwiki.eu,
	cpc-power.com, cpcrulez.fr and quasar.cpcscene.net.
	* The alpha tests were handled by the faithful and loyal Denis
	Lechevalier.

Version log
---

	* 20190430 -- ninth public release. Softer B/W Spectrum palette;
	fixed bug in FDC sector size calculation if GAP datas are stored
	(Loriciels' discs); added simple memory contention to ZXSEC
	("Amaurote", "Black Lamp", "Puzznic", "Sly Spy", "Zub"...).
	* 20190419 -- eighth public release. Added options for image and
	sound interpolation; tape automatically rewinds itself when it
	reaches the end (à la FUSE); fixed a bug in TZX files that store
	0 instead of 8 in the "used bits" field, another bug in CUSTOM
	INFO blocks in TZX files, and another one when ZXSEC loads a 48K
	SNA file in Plus3 mode (users should manually switch to a safe
	model beforehand anyway). INI files now remember the names of
	the last used files.
	* 20190408 -- seventh public release. Fixed a bug in the YM3
	file recording, another one in the ZXSEC internal timings, and
	one more in the debugger commands with optional parameters.
	* 20190404 -- sixth public release. Fixed a Z80 emulation bug in
	IRQ logic. Configuration (computer model and file paths) is kept
	across sessions in a INI file.
	* 20190331 -- fifth public release. Tapes can be browsed, either
	by file position (WAV and CSW) or by block (CDT, TZX and TAP).
	* 20190325 -- fourth public release. Onscreen indicators (hide
	them with -O); fixed bugs in ZXSEC that slowed emulation down
	when the frameskip wasn't zero, and another bug in audio
	recording on WAV files.
	* 20190318 -- third public release. By default the window shows
	a menu; new option -+ hides it.
	* 20190317 -- second public release. Fixed Win32 joystick bugs:
	JoyGetPos returns ZERO on OK, not on ERROR.
	* 20190314 -- first public release.
